# Set of Presets for the SPT Mod *Hephaestus*

---

I don’t like the Gunsmith questline and consider it brain-dead tedium.  
I also don’t want to spend my time learning how to mod SPT.  
So buying a finished weapon from the preset merchant and just handing it over is much more convenient.

## Requirements

- [Hephaestus](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/886-hephaestus/) – Go praise the author over there — all I did was shuffle some JSONs around and turned them into presets.
- SPT 3.11

---

## Installation

Just to be sure — yes, you **need** to install the Hephaestus mod first (link above).

Then it is just simple **drag and drop** — like any other mod.

## Included Presets

### MECHANIC

- **Gunsmith questline** – Don’t forget to fold the **AKSU**!

### PRAPOR

- **Test Drive questline** – Mainly for convenience; the presets use the exact guns you receive when accepting the quest.
- **Hell on Earth quest** – Included for good measure.

### TONY

- A random custom trader wants a **red AK**. Since it’s made from vanilla parts, I threw it in as well.

## Troubleshooting

No idea — it should work out of the box.  
If you don’t see the presets in-game, check the file paths.  
For example, if the mod folder is renamed for any reason in the future, you may need to move the files manually to their correct destination.
